Custom issue views enable you to tailor the issue stream experience in Sentry to your personal environment. With custom views, you have full control over which search query your issue stream renders by default, and what other queries are within a click's reach.


## Creating your first view

To create your first custom issue view, navigate to the **Issues** page and click on the **Add View** button. You'll be greeted by this page:

{/* TODO(msun) Insert image here once it's been updated for EA (current state of custom views is LA-specific) */}

Select a view from one of the recommended options, or create your own view from scratch by following these instructions:


1. **Name your view**: Give your view a descriptive name that reflects the issues it will display.
2. **Set your view's search query**: Choose the search query that will be applied by default when you select this view. Don't forget to hit enter to apply the query!
3. **Set your view's sort**: Select how you want the issues to be sorted in this view (e.g., by date, events, etc.)
4. **Save your view**: To save your view, click on the ellipsis menu within the tab and select **Save Changes**.

<Note>
If you previously had a default custom saved search, it will be automatically converted to a custom view and will appear as your first view automatically. Any other saved searches you created will be temporarily available in the **Add View** menu. Please save them as views if you wish to keep them.
</Note>

## Customizing your Views


#### Updating view queries and sorting

Views are primarily defined by their search query and sort order. When the query or sort is updated, an **unsaved changes indicator** (shown below) will appear above the tab's ellipsis to indicate that the current query/sort have diverged from the view's orginal query/sort. You can overwrite the view's original with the new query/sort by clicking the ellipsis menu and selecting **Save Changes**. If you want to discard your changes, you can similarly click **Discard Changes** within the ellipsis menu, or close your Sentry tab without saving.

#### Reordering views and setting a default view

Your views can be reordered in the tab list by dragging them to your desired position. You can set any of your views to be the default view that appears when you navigate to the **Issues** page. To do this, simply drag your view to the first position in the tab order.


#### Renaming views

To rename a view, first select it from the tab list. Then, either double click on the view's name or click the ellipsis menu and select **Rename**, then type in a new name and hit enter.


## Sharing views

Views were built specifically with sharability in mind. To share a view with someone else within your organization, simply copy the link to your issue view and send it to them. Anyone that clicks on the link will be navigate to a **temporary tab** that contains the same query and sort as your view. They can then save the view as their own by clicking **Save View**, or discard it by clicking **Discard**

TODO(msun) nomenclature that needs to be clarified:
    - Custom views?????
    - TAB vs VIEW
    - Tab menu button vs ellipsis menu
    - Temporary tab?
