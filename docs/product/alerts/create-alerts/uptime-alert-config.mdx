<Include name="feature-stage-beta-uptime.mdx" />

Sentry provides several configuration options to create an uptime alert based on your organization's needs.

## Environment

Specify which <PlatformLink to="/configuration/environments/">environment</PlatformLink> this alert rule belongs to. [Uptime issues](product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) from this alert rule will be set to the specified environment.

The “Environment” dropdown list here has the same environments that are available for the selected project in the common “Environment” filter dropdown (this does not include hidden environments).

## Project

Specify which project this alert rule belongs to. [Uptime issues](product/issues/issue-details/uptime-issues/) from this alert rule will be created in the specified project.

## Request Configuration

Configure how Sentry should execute an HTTP uptime check, by specifying:

- **URL**: The URL Sentry should execute an uptime check request for.
- **Method**: The request method used to execute the uptime check. Available options are `GET`, `POST`, `HEAD`, `PUT`, `DELETE`, `PATCH`, and `OPTIONS`.
- **Headers**: The request headers included in the uptime check request.
- **Body**: The body message to include in the uptime check request. Only available when the method is set to `POST`, `PUT`, and `PATCH`.

In case the specified URL requires a `Content-Type` header to be defined along with the body message, make sure to include it in the headers configuration. Example, a JSON message body would have a `Content-Type` header of `application/json`.

<Alert level="warning">

If the specified URL is behind a firewall, make sure Sentry's Uptime Bot can execute requests to it. [Learn more](http://localhost:3000/product/alerts/uptime-monitoring/troubleshooting/#verify-firewall-configuration).

## Alert Name

Give your alert a descriptive name, such as the page name. For example, "Landing Page" or "Contat Page".

## Ownership

You can choose a team to associate with an alert so that members of that team can edit the alert. Note that you can only make this association if you are a member of the team. If no team is selected, anyone can edit the alert.
