<Note>

Sentry Uptime Monitoring is currently in open beta, so be gentle - features are still in-progress and may have bugs. We recognize the irony.
For any questions or feedback, you can reach us on [Discord](https://discord.gg/sentry) or via email at [uptime-feedback@sentry.io](mailto:uptime-feedback@sentry.io).
